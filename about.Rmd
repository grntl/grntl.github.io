Hello! My name is Grant Li. My Chinese name is 李元. I'm a student at Northwestern University studying English literature and political science, with a minor in data science. I am also in the Northwestern University Marching Band (NUMB), Basketball Band, and Purple Band, which is a paid 29-piece ensemble that the athletic department arranges to perform at non-revenue sports events. Additionally, I work in the Art Library and I'm a Farrell Fellow with the Deportation Research Clinic here at Northwestern. 

I also write in the Daily Northwestern. You can find my writing here: https://dailynorthwestern.com/staff_name/grant-li/#

I like to read, although I don't do it as much as I should. You can find my goodreads here: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103275829-grant-li

Here is my resume: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ea1CQ9529bX6PmMmjtI8jp6s60oZ6NC1uccytfNZnY4/edit?usp=sharing 

I also like art (hence the pun in the website url), classical music, and the Utah Jazz.

## Blog

This website will also be kind of a blog where I intend to write about anything that interests me, likely things that I didn't have a chance to write into the Daily Northwestern.
