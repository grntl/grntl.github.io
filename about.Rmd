Hello! My name is Grant Li. My Chinese name is 李元. I was a student at Northwestern University where I studied English literature and political science, with a minor in data science. I was in the Northwestern University Marching Band (NUMB), Basketball Band, and Purple Band, which is a paid 29-piece ensemble that the athletic department arranges to perform at non-revenue sports events. Additionally, I worked in the Art Library and was a Farrell Fellow with the Deportation Research Clinic here at Northwestern.

I was Assistant Opinion Editor and Opinion Columnist during college: https://dailynorthwestern.com/staff_name/grant-li/#

I also like art (hence the pun in the url), classical music, and the Utah Jazz.
