Hello! My name is Grant Li. My Chinese name is 李元. I like reading, drawing, running, piano, and the Utah Jazz. I recently graduated from Northwestern University with majors in political science and English literature, and a minor in data science. There, I was an Assistant Opinion Editor and Opinion Columnist on The Daily Northwestern, a member of the marching band (NUMB), and a Farrell Fellow with the Deportation Research Clinic.
