    "contents": "\r\nThe pandemic and NYC’s transit\r\nAlthough coronavirus continues to circulate through new strains and variants, the world has for the most part emerged from the pandemic. Life is different, but by most respects America and much of the world has made a full (economic) recovery. Today, we’re going to look at whether New York City’s transit has also managed to return to its pre-pandemic state, or whether it has forever changed.\r\nNew York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) is basically the transit authority in charge of transit for New York City. Among the various things that the MTA manages are the following:\r\nNew York City Subway\r\nStaten Island Railway\r\nBus\r\nLong Island Rail Road (LIRR)\r\nMetro-North Railroad (commuter rail)\r\nSpecific bridges and tunnels\r\nAccess-A-Ride (AAR, a bus service for those with disabilities)\r\nThe MTA is an incredibly large system. The subway itself is in largest metro system in North America by a large margin, and actually makes the top ten metro systems of the world in terms of ridership. Consequently, the health and state of the MTA are very important.\r\nDuring the pandemic, ridership on public transit collapsed due to lockdowns and fears about the transmission of COVID-19. Additionally, people started working from home. Although COVID-19 fears have died down, many workplaces have remained remote or in a hybrid work arrangement, where people only come into the office on a few days of the week. The change in commuting patterns from the pandemic have no doubt left enduring impacts on our transit habits and systems.\r\nData\r\nThe MTA tracks data from the various transit options under its management, allowing us to get a good look into just exactly how the pandemic has affected New York City transit. The first dataset, which tracks daily ridership and traffic across the subway, Staten Island Railway, bus, LIRR, Metro-North, bridges and tunnels, and Access-A-Ride, can be found on New York state’s Open Data website: https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-Beginning-2020/vxuj-8kew. The data starts from March 1, 2020, the month the pandemic begins, and ends on August 20, 2023 when I downloaded the dataset from the website. Additionally, for each transit mode, there is also a proportion given of each day’s ridership as compared to a “comparable” pre-pandemic day. According to the data overview document provided with the dataset, the comparable pre-pandemic day is either the non-holiday weekday or the holiday/weekend monthly average from that month in 2019, respectively.\r\nThe second dataset tracks vehicle traffic through MTA’s seven toll bridges and two tunnels. It can also be found on the same New York Open Data website: https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Daily-Traffic-on-MTA-Bridges-Tunnels/fcbp-umit. This data starts on January 1, 2010, and ends August 19, 2023.\r\nThe first dataset is updated daily (on weekdays, it seems), while the second is updated weekly. I unfortunately could not find any daily ridership data from the MTA before 2020. However, I did find statistics on the MTA website showing yearly ridership numbers for a few years before the pandemic of both the subway and bus systems: https://new.mta.info/agency/new-york-city-transit/subway-bus-ridership-2021.\r\nRidership not fully recovered\r\nRidership has not completely recovered from the pandemic. There are still a few months left in 2023, but we can easily see that subway ridership will not reach pre-pandemic levels (2019 ridership numbers). Bus ridership seems to be getting close. Even without a full recovery, the subway is clearly the backbone of New York City transit, dwarfing other methods of transit in terms of ridership. The subway and the bus together show the value of public transit in New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Raw ridership numbers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing ratios of each day’s ridership to a comparable pre-pandemic day, we can see exactly how each mode of transit has suffered and recovered from the pandemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Relative ridership compared to before the pandemic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the very start, bridge and tunnel traffic and Access-A-Ride ridership never collapsed to the same degree as the other transit modes. This is especially evident in Figure 1 where bus ridership actually fell below vehicle traffic passing through MTA bridges and tunnels. The recovery of bridge and tunnel traffic and Access-A-Ride ridership have also been the most robust, being the only two transit modes to have already reached pre-pandemic levels of usage.\r\nAnother way to look at the recovery is through the distribution of daily ridership using the same pre-pandemic ridership comparison ratios. Most days in this past year, traffic through MTA bridges and tunnels and Access-A-Ride ridership tended to be close to pre-pandemic levels, whereas other forms of transit are still behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Relative ridership from the past year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccess-A-Ride’s usage demonstrates the importance of transit for those with disabilities. Even during the pandemic, those with disabilities still had places to go, perhaps even more so than those without disabilities, who might in various ways have an easier time avoiding transit or simply switching to driving.\r\nThe bridge and tunnel traffic also signals that vehicle traffic is also pushing beyond 2019 levels. There is a chance that this means many who used to commute by public transit now use their private vehicles instead. If we look at historical bridge and tunnel traffic data, vehicle traffic is indeed higher than ever, continuing an upward trend from before the pandemic, as if the pandemic never happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Traffic through MTA bridges and tunnels\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe collapse in bridge and tunnel traffic had largely returned to normal by mid-2021. I’m not entirely sure why there is an even bigger drop in 2017. I did some research and my best guess is that then-Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the tollbooths at MTA bridges and tunnels would be changed to open road cashless tolling, likely interrupting the tracking of vehicle traffic.1\r\nConsidering the massive lifestyle changes brought on by COVID, an indefinite decrease in public transit ridership is likely: there is no reason to expect ridership to naturally rebound to pre-pandemic levels. In fact, public transit ridership had been decreasing slightly even prior to the pandemic. The graph below shows the decreases ridership over the five years before the pandemic. Note that the graphs do not share the same y-axis, which slightly exaggerate the decrease, but I chose them so that the changes over the years are actually legible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Pre-pandemic ridership trends\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions: what should we do?\r\nDoes this mean that we should build more roads and car infrastructure because that is what the data shows people trending towards? Not really.\r\nThe problem with neutrally analyzing data with the purpose of looking for insights on how to act is that we forget the data can also simply reflect bad trends and behaviors that should be stopped. Not every trend we see in the data is a recommendation for us to act in such a way as to affirm it. In this case, New York City would by all means benefit from less private vehicle traffic and congestion, and more public transit usage.\r\nWhen it comes to the subway ridership specifically, we should remember that even with “only” one billion annual passengers the New York City subway system is still overburdened and needs enormous investments. In comparison to other metro systems of similar ridership and length, the New York City metro system is by far the most dilapidated and outdated. Sure, the stations don’t necessarily have to be so glamorous—the griminess is sometimes part of its charm—but things like platform screen doors, which are practically universal everywhere else in the world, are just basic safety measures that save lives and are long overdue.\r\nRecently, New York City announced that it was implementing congestion pricing, which charges drivers entering the city varying rates depending on the congestion levels.2 The money collected will go towards helping fund mass transit. Despite the fact that New Jersey has expressed outrage over the congestion pricing scheme,3 this is an excellent development that will help discourage the increased vehicle traffic that we are seeing post-pandemic. Every other method of public transit requires users to pay a fee, there is no reason why private vehicle owners should be any different.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.longisland.com/news/12-21-16/cuomo-open-road-tolling-mta-bridges-tunnels-2017.html↩︎\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc.html↩︎\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/07/nyregion/congestion-pricing-phil-murphy-new-jersey.html#:~:text=Congestion%20Pricing%3A%20A%20lawsuit%20that,led%20to%20charges%20of%20hypocrisy.↩︎\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n\r\nContents\r\nOn the wrong track\r\nOn the right track\r\nWhat more could I have done?\r\n\r\nIn the data science class I’m taking, they hosted a model-building competition across all three sections of the class, meaning there were at least 150 students participating, maybe 200. We had to build a model to predict the amount of money a bank would make back on a loan. The goal was to build a linear regression model that would produce the lowest RMSE.\r\n\r\nRMSE is Root Mean Squared Error. Basically you can think of it as a statistical measure to see how accurate your model is. In general you want it smaller.\r\n\r\nOn the wrong track\r\nAt the start, I did VIF testing on all the continuous variables. The VIF testing showed that none of them were egregiously multicollinear, only 2 or 3 of them were in the 5-10 range, which our professors had said was not good, but can be accepted nevertheless.\r\n\r\nVIF stands for Variable Inflation Factor, which basically just measures how much multicollinearity there is between your variables. Multicollinearity is where two variables are highly correlated, when really the variables in the model should be independent. VIF testing will give what you can think of as a multicollinearity rating for each variable, and usually having the number be below 5 means that it is good, whereas numbers from 5-10 are suspect, and above 10 means that the variable is highly correlated with another. The lower the number, the better.\r\n\r\nBecause our variable subsetting algorithms didn’t allow for categorical variables, I simply tried making models by running forward stepwise variable subsetting and then K-folds cross validation on the continuous variables and then adding categorical variables into the model after. I tried this for a day or two and it was clear that my RMSE wasn’t going to get under the 650 threshold that we had to get under for full credit on this assignment. It was stuck at 800 for a while.\r\n\r\nWithout getting too into the nitty-gritty, forward stepwise variable subsetting is a algorithm that allows you to pick the best set of predictors from your variables. K-folds cross validation is a method which helps compare and select models.\r\n\r\nOn the right track\r\nI decided that instead, I would try turn all the categorical variables into dummies, and do it all over again.\r\n\r\nA dummy variable is essentially turning, for example, a variable that has yes or no responses into two separate columns of yes and no, with 1s and 0s as the response. This way, the data becomes numerical and can be put into functions that otherwise only took continuous/numerical variables. Additionally, it allows the model to choose only the dummy variables that matter, like perhaps only the yes column with 1s and 0s is statistically significant, and the no column with 1s and 0s is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI technically should have done exploratory data analysis (EDA) and picked a few variables that would have worked best. But since my computer could handle it, I turned every single categorical variable into dummy variables, except emp_title and earliest_cr_line, since those had just way too many categories that it honestly wasn’t worth it. Even then, the forward stepwise variable subsetting took 20 minutes each time. While I ended up pursuing the brute-force method, I did end up doing EDA at the end which basically corroborated everything that was produced below.\r\nSince our k-folds cross validation function only takes 4 variables, I used the model with the 4 best predictors to find what I should put into the k-folds cross validation function. The best 4 variables were out_prncp_inv, loan_amnt, int_rate, and term_36_months, which is a dummy variable created from the term variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I put this through k-folds cross-validation, which added selected interactions. The k-folds cross validation was pretty impressive, because after working on this for days, it kind of stunned me to just watch the RMSE keep going down like that all the way to the 400s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were the interactions that the k-folds cross validation found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI then used the BIC curve to find the optimal number of predictors from the most recent forward stepwise variable subsetting.\r\n\r\nBIC stands for Bayesian information criterion. The BIC curve in this case stands for a curve that after variable subsetting, shows you what it believes to be the most ideal number of predictors is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curve says 33, but I found the 32 best predictors, not that the difference really matters that much. Here are some of them, since I literally can’t fit them in my screenshot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI tested each one of them by adding them into the model formula that we got from the k-folds cross validation, and saw if it decreased RMSE. After doing so, the ones that decreased the RMSE by any appreciable amount were grade_a and total_rec_late_fee. The final model formula looked like this, including the selected interactions earlier:\r\n\r\n# K-folds model with new predictors after testing predictors that appear in the \r\n# 32 predictor model\r\n\r\nmodel = sm.ols('money_made_inv ~ \r\n               out_prncp_inv + \r\n               loan_amnt + \r\n               int_rate + \r\n               term_36_months + \r\n               grade_a + \r\n               total_rec_late_fee' + \r\n                 selected_interactions, data = trainCopy).fit()\r\n\r\nAfter submitting this, it turns out that I was in the top 3 student submissions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber 1 is a professor, Arvind Krishna, so he doesn’t count. This was the public submission leaderboard, which only calculated the RMSE on 30% of the test data. I had no clue until the competition ended that there was also a private submission leaderboard that calculated the RMSE on 70% of the test data. That was the actual “final” ranking, where I was 9th, which is still really good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I kind of like my 3rd place finish on the public leaderboard more, not because I was 3rd as opposed to 9th, but because there were things like outlier removal, which did not lower the RMSE on the public submission board so I didn’t include it in my final submission, but could have on the private one if I could only have just seen the RMSE.\r\nWhat more could I have done?\r\nI could have also done some regularization with lasso or ridge.\r\n\r\nLasso and ridge help balance out the coefficients, and prevent the model from overfitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nFor our final project in my data science class, we had the option to either make static data visualizations, or a shiny application. I decided to make a shiny application with a data dashboard on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) data. You can find this dashboard at https://grantli.shinyapps.io/foiaapp/.\r\nMy research at the Deportation Research Clinic involves a lot of FOIA requests, particularly with the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR). The government often takes far longer to respond than what the law allows for. To force the government to follow the law and respond to our FOIA requests, we file complaints in court. One of the arguments that we have wanted to make with regards to this is that our the government under-funds EOIR’s FOIA response capabilities. To help prove this and help others have access to similar information, I built this portal using Department of Justice (DOJ) FOIA data.\r\nEssentially, government departments or agencies must put out a FOIA report every year with statistics on how they responded to FOIA requests that year. Unfortunately, up until now, much of this data was quite inaccessible. They are usually in XML files or PDF tables, and not aggregated well across agencies. There have been no data visualizations of this type of data. Luckily, there is a data portal where you can download CSV’s (comma-separated values, just think Excel spreadsheet) of department level data at: https://www.foia.gov/reports.html. Unfortunately the data portal sort of broke down (for me, at least) every time too many statistical measures were selected, so I downloaded them separately and manually collated them together.\r\nI hope that providing this dashboard will help make this data more accessible and understandable. Already, the data corroborates the argument that the EOIR’s FOIA respose capabilities are seriously underfunded. In the future, I intend on expanding it if I can to provide data for not just the DOJ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For example, here is a map I made for Rochester, New York that shows major roads and elevation. We were told we could make this as simple or as cool as we wanted, so I actually tried to do something unique and cool. I’ve always loved topographical maps because I love war history, and topography is key to understanding much of war strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHollister (2022); Pebesma (2022); Walker and Herman (2023); Garnier (2021); Pebesma (2018); Wickham et al. (2019);1\r\nChinese demographics in Litchfield County, CT\r\nLater, there was a bonus (worth 0 points?!) to make an interactive map on your own. They did not actually teach us how to do the interactive part, so it was entirely up to us whether we wanted to teach ourselves or not. After doing a lot of digging and research, I figured out how to make an interactive map for the Chinese population in Litchfield County, Connecticut. I was specifically interested in this particular county because I am Chinese and grew up in New Milford, a town in Litchfield County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheng, Karambelkar, and Xie (2022)\r\nWhat can we learn from this map? There appears to be 4 main concentrations of Chinese people around Litchfield County: New Milford (yellow), Kent on the middle-left (green), Salisbury on the top-left (blue), and some patches of turquoise near Waterbury on the bottom-right.\r\nNow if you are from the area, you will know that Waterbury is quite big of a city, so it’s entirely unsurprising that there are more Chinese people living in their suburbs. Additionally, New Milford is the last sizeable population aside from Torrington before going any further north, and also acts somewhat like a suburb of Danbury. It makes sense that there are some Chinese residents here. However, Kent and Salisbury are a little more puzzling; both have about two streets in their town. Even New Milford having 103 people in that one yellow census tract is extremely surprising: having lived there, I basically knew almost every Chinese family in town and could basically count them on my fingers. Where were they all?\r\nWell it turns out, what New Milford, Kent, and Salisbury all have in common are private schools. The rich, old money, elite kind. In New Milford, we have the Canterbury School, Kent has the Kent School, and Salisbury has perhaps the most notorious of the three: the Hotchkiss School. Rich Chinese families are sending their kids to these private schools. There are probably a bunch of Chinese students within Canterbury’s campus that I have simply never seen before (I attended the town’s public school, New Milford High School).\r\nI hope you found this interesting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheng, Joe, Bhaskar Karambelkar, and Yihui Xie. 2022.
