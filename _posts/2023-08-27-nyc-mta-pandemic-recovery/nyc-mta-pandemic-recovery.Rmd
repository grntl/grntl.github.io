### The pandemic and NYC's transit

Although coronavirus continues to circulate through new strains and variants, the world has for the most part emerged from the pandemic. Life is different, but by most respects America and much of the world has made a full (economic) recovery. Today, we're going to look at whether New York City's transit has also managed to return to its pre-pandemic state, or whether it has forever changed.

New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) is basically the transit authority in charge of transit for New York City. Among the various things that the MTA manages are the following:

* New York City Subway
* Staten Island Railway
* Bus
* Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)
* Metro-North Railroad (commuter rail)
* Specific bridges and tunnels
* Access-A-Ride (AAR, a bus service for those with disabilities)

The MTA is an incredibly large system. The subway itself is in largest metro system in North America by a large margin, and actually makes the top ten metro systems of the world in terms of ridership. Consequently, the health and state of the MTA are very important.

During the pandemic, ridership on public transit collapsed due to lockdowns and fears about the transmission of COVID-19. Additionally, people started working from home. Although COVID-19 fears have died down, many workplaces have remained remote or in a hybrid work arrangement, where people only come into the office on a few days of the week. The change in commuting patterns from the pandemic have no doubt left enduring impacts on our transit habits and systems. 

### Data

The MTA tracks data from the various transit options under its management, allowing us to get a good look into just exactly how the pandemic has affected New York City transit. The first dataset, which tracks daily ridership and traffic across the subway, Staten Island Railway, bus, LIRR, Metro-North, bridges and tunnels, and Access-A-Ride, can be found on New York state's Open Data website: https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-Beginning-2020/vxuj-8kew. The data starts from March 1, 2020, the month the pandemic begins, and ends on August 20, 2023 when I downloaded the dataset from the website. Additionally, for each transit mode, there is also a proportion given of each day's ridership as compared to a "comparable" pre-pandemic day. According to the data overview document provided with the dataset, the comparable pre-pandemic day is either the non-holiday weekday or the holiday/weekend monthly average from that month in 2019, respectively.

The second dataset tracks vehicle traffic through MTA's seven toll bridges and two tunnels. It can also be found on the same New York Open Data website: https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Daily-Traffic-on-MTA-Bridges-Tunnels/fcbp-umit. This data starts on January 1, 2010, and ends August 19, 2023.

The first dataset is updated daily (on weekdays, it seems), while the second is updated weekly. I unfortunately could not find any daily ridership data from the MTA before 2020. However, I did find statistics on the MTA website showing yearly ridership numbers for a few years before the pandemic of both the subway and bus systems: https://new.mta.info/agency/new-york-city-transit/subway-bus-ridership-2021.

### Ridership not fully recovered

Ridership has not completely recovered from the pandemic. There are still a few months left in 2023, but we can easily see that subway ridership will not reach pre-pandemic levels (2019 ridership numbers). Bus ridership seems to be getting close. Even without a full recovery, the subway is clearly the backbone of New York City transit, dwarfing other methods of transit in terms of ridership. The subway and the bus together show the value of public transit in New York City.

```{r raw, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "Raw ridership numbers"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_posts/2023-08-27-nyc-mta-pandemic-recovery/rawRidership.png"))
```

Using ratios of each day's ridership to a comparable pre-pandemic day, we can see exactly how each mode of transit has suffered and recovered from the pandemic. 

```{r relative, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "Relative ridership compared to before the pandemic"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_posts/2023-08-27-nyc-mta-pandemic-recovery/avgMonthlyProp.png"))
```

From the very start, bridge and tunnel traffic and Access-A-Ride ridership never collapsed to the same degree as the other transit modes. This is especially evident in Figure \@ref(fig:raw) where bus ridership actually fell below vehicle traffic passing through MTA bridges and tunnels. The recoveries of bridge and tunnel traffic and Access-A-Ride ridership have also been the most robust, being the only two transit modes to have already reached pre-pandemic levels of usage. 

Another way to look at the recovery is through the distribution of daily ridership using the same pre-pandemic ridership comparison ratios. Most days in this past year, traffic through MTA bridges and tunnels and Access-A-Ride ridership tended to be close to pre-pandemic levels, whereas other forms of transit are still behind. 

```{r distribution, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "Relative ridership from the past year"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_posts/2023-08-27-nyc-mta-pandemic-recovery/propGraph.png"))
```

Access-A-Ride's usage demonstrates the importance of transit for those with disabilities. Even during the pandemic, those with disabilities still had places to go, perhaps even more so than those without disabilities, who might in various ways have an easier time avoiding transit or simply switching to driving. 

The bridge and tunnel traffic signals that vehicle traffic is also pushing beyond 2019 levels. There is a chance that this means many who used to commute by public transit now use their private vehicles instead. If we look at historical bridge and tunnel traffic data, vehicle traffic is indeed higher than ever, continuing an upward trend from before the pandemic, as if the pandemic never happened.

```{r car, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "Traffic through MTA bridges and tunnels"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("_posts/2023-08-27-nyc-mta-pandemic-recovery/carTraffic.png"))
```

The collapse in bridge and tunnel traffic had largely returned to normal by mid-2021. I'm not entirely sure why there is an even bigger drop in 2017. I did some research and my best guess is that then-Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the tollbooths at MTA bridges and tunnels would be changed to open road cashless tolling, likely interrupting the tracking of vehicle traffic.^[https://www.longisland.com/news/12-21-16/cuomo-open-road-tolling-mta-bridges-tunnels-2017.html] 

Considering the massive lifestyle changes brought on by COVID, an indefinite decrease in public transit ridership is likely: there is no reason to expect ridership to naturally rebound to pre-pandemic levels. In fact, public transit ridership had been decreasing slightly even prior to the pandemic. The graph below shows the decreases ridership over the five years before the pandemic. Note that the graphs do not share the same y-axis, which slightly exaggerate the decrease, but I chose them so that the changes over the years are actually legible.

```{r preP, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "Pre-pandemic ridership trends"}

```

### Conclusions: what should we do?

Does this mean that we should build more roads and car infrastructure because that is what the data shows people trending towards? Not really.

The problem with neutrally analyzing data with the purpose of looking for insights on how to act is that we forget the data can also simply reflect bad trends and behaviors that should be stopped. Not every trend we see in the data is a recommendation for us to act in such a way as to affirm it. In this case, New York City would by all means benefit from less private vehicle traffic and congestion, and more public transit usage.

When it comes to the subway ridership specifically, we should remember that even with "only" one billion annual passengers the New York City subway system is still overburdened and needs enormous investments. In comparison to other metro systems of similar ridership and length, the New York City metro system is by far the most dilapidated and outdated. Sure, the stations don't necessarily have to be so glamorous—the griminess is sometimes part of its charm—but things like platform screen doors, which are practically universal everywhere else in the world, are just basic safety measures that save lives and are long overdue.

Recently, New York City announced that it was implementing congestion pricing, which charges drivers entering the city varying rates depending on the congestion levels.^[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nyc.html] The money collected will go towards helping fund mass transit. Despite the fact that New Jersey has expressed outrage over the congestion pricing scheme,^[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/07/nyregion/congestion-pricing-phil-murphy-new-jersey.html#:~:text=Congestion%20Pricing%3A%20A%20lawsuit%20that,led%20to%20charges%20of%20hypocrisy.] this is an excellent development that will help discourage the increased vehicle traffic that we are seeing post-pandemic. Every other method of public transit requires users to pay a fee, there is no reason why private vehicle owners should be any different.
